# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andy.

Welcome to my Aladdin's cave of odds and ends. You'll find things related to trading, web and software development here, as well as anything 
else I might've added here at some point. Some projects were put together for fun, but others are more serious in nature. In each repository,
I've included a README.md which includes a brief outline of the purpose of the project in question, as well as instructions for setting it up 
on your own system. 

## ðŸ“« Need to reach me?

You can do so using the links provided on this page. I'm happy to help with anything you might need relating to the repositories listed here.
